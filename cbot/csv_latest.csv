Question,Answer
What is the base retention schedule in Doc Central,"The base retention in Doc Central is 3 years from the document version's creation date.  Note the word ""version"".  If you have 10 versions and 4 of them are older than 3 years, those would be deleted and the remaining 6 would be kept until their 3 years are up.  Certain folder structures (i.e. Engineering, Cisco Services) have longer base retention policies."
What are some of the longer retention policies,Longer retention schedules are applied for Engineering and Cisco Services documents. Engineering is 25 years.  Cisco Services can vary but is 15 - 25 years.  If you place new documents into any of these folders they will inherit the folders retention policy.
How long Records retain in system,RECORDS must be retained for the period specified in the Record Retention Schedule

What is Records Management in Doc Central,"An organized, pro-active approach to records management helps assure we don’t fall victim to the pitfalls that companies can face when they don’t invest in their records management & governance controls. These pitfalls include issues such as problems with audits (Tax, ISO,S-OX,etc) or legal discovery.
Since there are multiple Digital Platforms at Cisco, Doc Central has been identified as the only approved repository for long term storage of critical Cisco information. Doc Central has automated features to ensure content is kept and deleted according to Cisco’s Records Retention Schedule, so that it meets legal and regulatory requirements."
What is Purge in Doc Central,"Purge is being implemented to comply with Cisco policy as well as manage the growth of Doc Central by removing documents that no longer have business value and are not required to be retained for legal or regulatory purpose per the Records Management Policy and the Electronic Information Disposition Policy.
Documents will be permanently deleted 3 years from their creation date unless they are marked as a records or placed on legal hold. The purge applies to both current and previous versions of documents. Each version will have its own deletion date based on its creation date."
RETENTION SCHEDULES,"The Enterprise Records Retention Schedule (ERRS) is a comprehensive list of record categories, indicating the length of time a record is to be retained."
ERIM Policies and Process,"Please click on the below link for detailed information on ERIM Policies and Process : 
https://cisco.jiveon.com/groups/enterprise-records-and-information-management-erim/projects/policy-process"
Who is responsible for Records Management in Doc Central,"All Cisco employees and contractors are responsible to ensure their records meet the legal and regulatory compliance requirements which are part of the Records Management Policy 
Each team should identify specific individuals as Business Retention Managers for their team folders. These individuals will be able to create and manage records management rules and mark folders as records. This ensures that there is consistency among rules that are being created and an oversight among the team on what content is being marked as records.
To get started as a Business Retention Manager, email  doc_central_biz_retention_manager@cisco.com and you will receive a short training video. Once you confirm you have reviewed the video, you will be added as a Business Retention Manager."
Why is Cisco doing Purge,To comply with Cisco policy as well as manage the growth of Doc Central by removing documents that no longer have business value and are not required to be retained for legal or regulatory purpose per the Records Management Policy and the Electronic Information Disposition Policy.
Do I need Records Management on my information,"Records Management plays an important role in keeping your team’s content compliant with policy, relevant, up to date and easy to find. However, not all information qualifies as records. Please review What is a Record to identify which folders in your organization should be managed as records."
What does retention mean,"Retention means there is a responsibility to ensure that the information is not deleted until the required time period is met. The time period to retain information is dictated by Cisco's Enterprise Records and Retention Schedule. In Doc Central, retention is applied by the Records Management functionality using Cisco's Enterprise Records and Retention Schedule."
How can I understand what are my organization's records under Cisco's policy,Please review What is a Record to identify which content in your organization should be managed as records.
How Records Management works in Doc Central,"Records Management works at a folder level in Doc Central to identify and keep important business documents for the required amount of time. We have simplified the process by which your team can identify applicable information categories (such as Finance, Marketing, Engineering,etc.) at a folder level and the system will ensure the documents are retained and deleted according to policy."
 How do I implement Records Management in my folders ,"Doc Central has an intuitive rules based approach to mark your folders as records. As a Business Retention Manager for your team, you will be able to create simple records management rules on one or more of your team folders in Doc Central.
When you create a rule, you will use a drop down menu to choose a applicable 'Records Category'. Once this rule is created and saved, any document or folder created under this folder will automatically become a record and will be retained for the appropriate time period."
How do I become a Business Retention Manager,"Only specific individuals within a business unit can create and manage records management rules and mark folders as records. This ensures that there is consistency among rules that are being created and an oversight among the team on what content is being marked as records.
 In order to determine who will become the Business Retention Manager for your folder(s), please consult with others (team members, cross-functional partners) who have an interest in the documents.
 To get started as a Business Retention Manager, email  doc_central_biz_retention_manager@cisco.com and you will receive a short training video. Once you confirm you have reviewed the video, you will be added as a Business Retention Manager."
What is difference in the process of managing records in Cisco Docs vs. Doc Central,"In Cisco Docs, the process of marking folders as records involved linking your folders to a central records retention folder using WebTop interface.
 In Doc Central, the process of marking folders as records is driven by creating simple business rules on a folder. This change in process saves time by avoiding switching between multiple folder structures."
"I am in Engineering, Services or Supply Chain. Do I have to apply retention to my content","All documents stored under the Engineering, Services and Supply Chain folders will automatically be retained according to Cisco Quality/ISO guidelines and the retention schedule. Users will not be able to apply additional retention rules on these folders (either longer or shorter). Documents will not be able to be deleted from these folders. However, new versions can be added on documents that are under retention."
"What do I need to know about records management for documents that have been migrated into Doc Central from other repositories (e.g EDCS, Jive, WebEx Social, Web Services, Shared Drive, etc)","The records management process for documents migrated into Doc Central is the same as for content created in Doc Central- users need to mark their folders as records. The only exception would be for Engineering, Supply Chain and Services documents migrated from EDCS - these documents will automatically be retained in Doc Central according to the retention schedule."
How do I apply retention to my folders,Retention is applied through creating a Records Management rule on a folder. Step-by-step instructions are available https://cisco.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-1504395
Will retention apply to versions,"Yes, when retention is applied at the folder level, then it will cascade to all versions."
Will I be able to move my records once retention is applied,"Yes, you will be able to move to documents which have records retention applied to it"
What if I mistakenly apply retention and need to remove it,"Currently, the system does not have the capability to remove or undo a retention policy applied to a document. Please contact the ERIM team to get assistance on available options/workarounds to address the issue."
How can I tell if my record is under Retention,"Records under retention will have ""Lock & Clock""  icon displayed to the left of documents."
What happens if Legal Hold is applied on a document with Retention Policy,"If a document is on legal hold, the records management policy will be suspended until the hold has been removed. We anticipate Legal Hold functionality will be live approximately in Q1 FY18.
 Note : A legal hold is a process that an organization uses to preserve all forms of relevant information when litigation is reasonably anticipated."
What is Doc Central Purge,Documents will be permanently deleted 3 years from their creation date unless they are marked as a records or placed on legal hold. The purge applies to both current and previous versions of documents. Each version will have its own deletion date based on its creation date.
What is difference in the process of managing non-records in Cisco Docs vs. Doc Central,"In Cisco Docs, non-records are moved to an archive 3 years after their creation date and permanently deleted from the archive after 1 year. Users are also able to restore a document within the 1 year time period while its in the archive.
 In Doc Central, non-records will be permanently deleted 3 years after their creation date. There is no additional archival of 1 year nor restoration capability."
How can I prevent my documents from being deleted,"If your non-record documents have ongoing business value, you should mark them as records . Click here to see step by step instructions to mark folders as records. Please note that the deletion of records cannot be avoided, but new versions can always be added. A new deletion date will be set based on the new version's creation date."
When will purge be implemented,The purge functionality will only be implemented after the Legal Hold functionality is in place. We anticipate Legal Hold functionality will be live approximately in Q1FY18. The purge functionality will go-live shortly thereafter.

hi,Hello 
What is Doc Central,Doc Central is the new document storage solution at Cisco Systems that will in time replace the current EDCS and Cisco Docs systems
What's the difference between Doc Central and EDCS or Cisco Docs,"Doc Central is the eventual replacement for both EDCS and Cisco Docs.  It is an ISO approved content management system that will contain all of the features you have today in both systems plus new features.  The Documentum platform on which Cisco Docs is built is not being supported by EMC to the degree that Cisco requires and this, plus a need to consolidate multiple content management systems in Cisco today is a big driver for Doc Central.  Feature set will be enriched in Doc Central but the core functionality will remain the same"
"Doc Central, Jive, Box ... which system should I use for what",There are a lot of different options available and Cisco is working hard to consolidate them and provide guidance and where to put your stuff.  For more information visit the Digital Solutions Center.
Is Doc Central ISO approved,"Yes, Doc Central is an ISO approved content management repository for your documents.  There is an approval workflow and document versioning."
How do I login to Doc Central,You can log into Doc Central using your CEC credentials.  Doc Central uses Cisco's Single-Sign-On (SSO) system so once you log into an SSO supported tool you can access any other SSO tool without the need to sign in again.
How do I get started using Doc Central,"To get started using Doc Central you need to obtain access to an area where you have permissions to create new content.  The two best ways to do this are:
1. See if other members of your team have already set up an area in Doc Central.  If they have you can simply ask them for access to the folder location.  Each area has a Folder Admin and each file has an Owner who can add users with the correct roles so they can create, edit, preview, download and manage content.  To request access select the Show Owner button for a file and Show Admin for a folder.
2. If you want a new folder to be created select the Request New Folder button so you can get an area for you or your group to work in."
What browsers does Doc Central officially support,"Doc Central officially supports the following browsers
Internet Explorer 10 and 11
Google Chrome (latest version)
Firefox (latest version)
Other browsers may work fine but we only test these three so please do not open a support case if you have issues with other browsers."
What types of files can I store in Doc Central,Doc Central will store most any file type.  We do however ask that you do not upload video files due to their size.  After upload Microsoft Office document types can be previewed in the browser window and used to generate PDF files.
What is the maximum individual file size allowed,"There is no limit presently set when uploading a file into Doc Central. That said, depending on your network connection, you may experience upload issues if the file is larger than 1 GB."
Where do I go for Doc Central support,"Open a Remedy case. To open a Remedy case go to Remedy and search on ""Doc Central"" to find the appropriate case to use.
Email the Doc Central support team using the doc-central-level1@cisco.com mailer.  Please do not over use this mailer without also opening a Remedy case."
What file extension types can be previewed in Doc Central,Any Microsoft Office document can be previewed in Doc Central using an approved browser unless the file is either locked down with no view permissions or it exceeds the preview limit.  Currently these limits vary depending on the file type.  Only role not to allow previewing is the User role.
Is there an API available to interface with Doc Central,There is a RESTful API available.  This API will allow you to interface with the Doc Central application and perform basic operations.  For more information visit our Doc Central / Doc Exchange Web Services: Setup & Engagement page
How does Doc Central use Grouper and Mailer for organizing groups,Doc Central supports both mailer and grouper groups.  To see how these can be configured and applied review our video tutorial
Can I use Active Directory (AD) groups to control permissions,Yes you can ... indirectly.  Since Doc Central supports Grouper groups and mailer groups you can place an AD group inside one of those.  Below see an example snap shot of some HR maintained groups for manager Jordan Jones (jorjones) for regular employees and C Workers.
Can I add and remove users from an active workflow,"Yes, as of April 14th, 2017 this feature is available.  Use the Update Approvers button which is visible to anyone who started the workflow."
Can I update the document that is in an active workflow,No.  It is best to review the doc using PRRQ or offline and then running it through a workflow for ISO compliance.
Are there any Doc Central video tutorials,The Doc Central team has created a set of training videos which you can find here.
Where can I find out more about Records Management and Purge functionality in Doc Central,"Records Management enables users to apply retention policies and make sure important Cisco content is kept for the right amount of time, while the purge functionality ensures compliance with Cisco policy and helps to manage the growth of Doc Central by removing documents that no longer have business value and are not required to be retained for legal or regulatory purpose. Learn more about Records Management and Purge in the FAQ."
How do I add new files,There are two ways to add files into Doc Central but for either you need to have write access to the folder you are wanting to use.  Write access in Doc Central is called the Editor role.
To check if you have write access,The Upload button is not greyed out when you navigate to the folder you want to write into.  If you attempt to drag and drop files into the folder you will immediately get an Upload screen telling you that your files will be accepted.
To ask for access ...,Select the Show Admin button for any file you do not have access too and ask for the Editor role.
Can I drag and drop an entire folder into Doc Central,You can select multiple files and do a single drag and drop of those files into a folder you have write access to (Editor role). You cannot drag and drop a folder for the purpose of inputting an entire folder and its contents into Doc Central.
How do I create a new folder,"To create a new folder you need to have the Folder Admin role in the location you wish to create it.  If you do you will see the Create New Folder button and it will not be greyed out.  If it is greyed out then select the Request New Folder button which is right alongside it.  This button will display a screen where you can ask for a new folder to be created and select the folder admin(s) you want the request to go too.
If there are no Folder Admin's provisioned in this location you will be provided a link to open a Remedy case to have the folder created."
What special characters are not allowed in file and folder names,"‘.'  is allowed only in-between, not at the end of folder names
':', '*', '/' , '\' , '?’ , '<' , '>', '“” ', ’|’ are not allowed at all in either folder 0r file name"
How do I preview files on Doc Central,"The ability to preview files in Doc Central is available to anyone who has the Viewer role or higher. When you click on a file name you will go into the screen where the preview pane will appear.  If the file does not preview it could be one of the following reasons:
You do not have the Viewer or higher role
The document is not a Microsoft Office document. Only MS Office documents can be previewed.
The file you are trying to preview is too big. There is a limit on the size of files that can be previewed and each file type has its own limits.
"
How do I move files and folders,In order to move files or folders you need to be a Folder Admin.  If you are not contact one to perform the operation.  If you are a Folder Admin you will see the Move To button in the Document Actions menu.

Share a file location in Doc Central"
How do I get a PDF file share link,"Sharing a file in Doc Central with others is easy.  Share links share the original file type for a document (Word,Excel ...) but you can also share PDF's for these same files if you have generated a PDF.  There are different variations of share links for files such as ... 
Replace the EDCS # shown with your number"
How do I get a share link to a folder,Folder share links are available in the same location as your file share links.  Simply click on the Share link to copy/paste your link.  This link remains static regardless if you move or rename the folder you are sharing.
How do I get a download link for a document,"There are several types of download links available in Doc Central for a document. All of these links are ""predictable"" and useful for placing in on a web site or Wiki/Jive page."
Getting a download to a PDF file,"If you want a download link to a PDF file and the file was not brought into Doc Central originally as a PDF file, you will need to generate the PDF version first.  A RED PDF icon means there is no PDF version yet generated and one needs to be. If there is a WHITE PDF icon then you can click on the icon and get your PDF version. Remember that unlike the above links the PDF links always link to a particular version of a document."
How do I create a PDF copy of a document,"In EDCS a PDF was created anytime you uploaded a Microsoft Office document into the system.  In Doc Central, to save space, we only create PDF copies of Microsoft Office documents when you request one.  To see if one needs to be created look at the PDF icon next to the version.  If it is RED then you need to request one,  if it is WHITE then it is created and can be downloaded.  To request a PDF just click on the RED icon.  You will receive an email once it is created.  See below screen shot:"
How do I mark a file or folder as a favorite,"Marking content as a ""favorite"" allows you to easily get back to the document at a later time.  You can mark a file or folder as a favorite either from the folder view or document view screens.
which when clicked turns it into a yellow star …"
How can I access my favorites,At the top of the any page in the black menu area you will see a My Favorites menu which can be clicked on to access your favorites.  To add a favorite see the above FAQ question on making a folder or file one of your favorites.
How can I delete a file,Currently the ability to delete a file is not present in Doc Central.  Since it is an ISO approved repository we need to put certain checks against users being able to perform this action.  Since Cisco Docs does allow this we are working on a solution.
How can I delete a folder,"Folders can be deleted by a Folder Admin as long as they are empty. If they are not empty, the contents must be moved to another location before you can delete it."
Microsoft Office cut and paste links do not redirect correctly into Doc Central,"If you are finding that a if you attempt to cut and paste a link into a Microsoft Office document (like Word) and the link does not redirect correctly into Doc Central, perform the steps below to fix the issue."
What are some common troubleshooting tips when I encounter an issue,"Doc Central, like any browser based solution, can have browser related issues that can sometimes be fixed by doing the following:
Clear your browser cache.
Try a different browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox or Chrome)
 "
Expanding the Document tree keeps jumping me to the top of the page,When traversing the Document tree if you click on the name of the folder it will expand and jump you back to the top of the Document tree (all browsers).  If you click on the folder icon next to the folder name it will expand and leave you where you are.  Use this tip to make moving through the Document tree faster.
Why is my document not previewing correctly in the browser window,There are several reasons why a document will not preview correctly in a browser window and they mostly have to do with how Doc Central generates PDF versions of the file (in the background) but cannot do so in certain cases.  We are working on surfacing up these reasons but for now use this list to help debug your issue.
What do you mean by a document life cycle,Doc Central refers to a document's life cycle when we are talking about version history as well as ISO workflow history.
Version History,Any time a new version of a document is uploaded into Doc Central the version is incremented. The increment can be managed by you and can be a minor version (i.e. 1.1 -> 1.2) or a major version (1.0 -> 2.0). At the time of upload you can give an explanation of your reason for the version change.
Workflow History,Documents that go through a workflow create a workflow history that can be accessed at any time. Currently the only workflow in Doc Central is an Approval Workflow. Details on how to run an approval workflow can be found in another FAQ post. To access a document's workflow history click on the link in the document preview page under Workflows. See screen shot.
How do I check out a document,"To checkout a document in Doc Central you need to have the Folder Admin, Owner or Editor permission role on the document. If you do navigate to the document's preview page and checkout the document from the Document Actions menu. When you checkout a document you lock it from others so they cannot checkout the document and edit it while you are doing so.  The checkout operation will open a download window so you can download a copy of the document to your system to work on."
How do I check in a document (also called Upload New Version),"Checking In a document is also called ""Upload New Version"". This action will upload the new version and remove the check out operation. You will notice that if you checked out a document you will also have the ability to cancel the checkout."
Why is it called Upload New Version,"It is called this because unlike EDCS where you had to Checkout a document in order to put in a new version, in Doc Central you can upload a new version without the need to check the old one out.  The only reason to checkout is to lock the file so others cannot work on it."
What's the difference between a Working Copy and an Original Document,"When a document is checked out a Working Copy of the file is created and downloaded out of Doc Central for you to work on. Along with the Working Copy their is also an Original Document which for all purposes is the same document. The reason for this is that the base Alfresco product allowed for online editing but the Cisco version, to date, does not."
How do I see the version history,The version history is displayed on the folder view as well as the page view page.  On the folder view we only display the latest three versions but in the page view we display them all.  The Version History is located on the right side of the document details page.
What are the different states for a document,"Doc Central has the following states for a document:
Approval N.A. (default state)
Draft
Approved
Obsolete
Grandfathered  (state assigned to some old documents migrated into Doc Central from outside systems)"
How can I change document state,"You must be an Owner, Editor or Folder Admin to change a document's state from Approval N.A. to Draft or into Obsolete. To make a document Approved it must go through an approval workflow which again can only be started by the same three roles. A document needs to be in the Draft state in order to start a workflow on it."
Where is Basic Search and what does it search on,"Basic Search is located in the upper right corner of your browser window when you log into Doc Central.  From this search window you can search for a document based on values found in their Title, Description, EDCS number or Tag value.  If you select drop down menu you be given an opportunity to proceed to the Advanced Search page."
Where is Advanced Search search and what does it search on,Advanced Search is found by selecting the drop down menu option found in the Basic Search Window.
What are the different roles and levels of permissions in Doc Central,"Each group will be assigned a folder structure for their documents. This folder structure will have one or more Folder Admins who will have the ability to create sub-folders and move documents into different sub-folders. To understand how you can use these different Doc Central roles let's review what they are (from least permissions to most).
A User is anyone at Cisco who has CEC credentials. They can log into Doc Central and view top level document information (title, author, etc ...). They cannot view or perform any actions on any documents.
A Reader can do anything a Viewer can do plus they have the ability to download a copy of the document.
A Viewer can preview a document online but cannot edit, download or perform any actions on it.
An Editor can perform everything a Reader can do plus editing actions such as checking a document in or out of the system and starting an approval or review workflow.  If someone has the Editor role on a folder they can bring documents into that folder which they will become an Owner of.
An Owner of a document is the user that first uploaded the document into Doc Central repository. They can perform all Editor role actions plus edit document properties and assign roles to other users for this document. Any new document uploaded into Doc Central automatically gives that user the Owner role but owners can also assign other users as an Owner/Editor/Reader/Viewer as well.  Finally Owners can use Grouper groups and assign role's on a group level.
A Folder Admin can do anything an Owner can do, but the purpose of the Folder Admin role is to manage an area's folders and not its documents. Folder Admins can create folders underneath the group's top level folder area, move documents between these folders as well as manage permissions for any user as it pertains to these folders and documents. They can also set up ""rules"" for a folder when certain things occur. A Folder Admin's ""job"" is to administer a group's document area, adding new users into it and managing the permissions on those users. The idea of the Folder Admin is to allow self administration of a group's area so as to reduce the need for IT support.
A Power Admin can do anything a Folder Admin can do plus they can add/remove any role to any folder or file at any time with no restrictions. This is a special role reserved for rare cases where this capability is required."
Who controls the roles and permissions in Doc Central,"The Folder Admin and document Owner control the roles and permissions assigned. Folder Admins control folders as well as files that reside in those folders (in most cases). An Owner controls the permissions on any file they own. In order to own a file, you need to be the user who initially brought the file into Doc Central or you need to be given the Owner role by the owner or a Folder Admin."
How do I know what role I have on a file or folder,When viewing a file either at the folder or file level view you will always see the highest level of permissions (i.e. role) for that object.
What is inheritance and what does it do,"Permission inheritance allows a document or folder to inherit the permissions from a folder higher up in the directory tree. Permissions can be inherited, set locally on the file or folder or both."
How do I provide access to my documents to everyone at Cisco,The answer is to use the default EVERYONE role that is in Doc Central. This group is everyone in Cisco who has access to Doc Central (i.e. anyone with CEC credentials). Give EVERYONE the Reader role for the documents/folders you wish to allow view rights for if you want them to Preview or Download a copy and Viewer role if you only want them to preview it online.
How do I share with customers and partners,Doc Central has an external sharing application integrated into it called Doc Exchange. Doc Exchange allows you to share content with customers and partners as long as they have CCO login credentials. You can share specific files or folders with specific customers. See Doc Exchange FAQS for more information.
How do I share Doc Central folders and files with my colleagues,"To share files in Doc Central all you need to do is include a Share Link in any email, post or correspondence and make sure that the people you are wanting to share it with have the correct access role assigned. The Share link can be found on the folder view or page preview view.
 
Roles to allows users to access content can be assigned using the Manage Permissions feature which is accessible to Owners and Folder Admins. Viewer role will allow users to preview the document in a browser, Reader will allow them to download a copy and Editor will allow them to edit and update the document."
How do I change the owner of a file,"To change or add an Owner to a file you need to be an Owner or Folder Admin on the file you wish to update. If you are do the following:
1. Select Manage Permissions button
2. Search for the user you wish to add in as an Owner
3. Add the user to the file and assign the Owner role"
How do I view the permissions on a file or folder,"On any file or folder in the system you can see your permissions on that object by looking for the Permission Role statement. This statement will be unique to you and your permissions for that object. On top of that, if you see a RED DOT next to the statement it denotes that permission inheritance is off."
Can I remove the EVERYONE group and what is it there for,The User role assigned to the EVERYONE group is a default user group placed on all content in Doc Central.  The purpose of this group is to allow everyone in the system to see all the content and to be able to perform searches to find this content. Note that the EVERYONE group provides very limited access to a document or folder.
Applying the User role EVERYONE can,"See that the item exists
See the title of the document, author and last modified date.
See the item as part of a search result"
Applying the User role EVERYONE cannot,"Preview, Edit, Download a Copy or perform any action other than seeing that the content exists.
 
Some users have requested that User role for EVERYONE be removed. IT can remove the User role for EVERYONE on your folder for special cases. If you have a valid use case to restrict or hide even the existence of your content from all but a select few users, please open a Remedy case and we will evaluate the request."
What types of workflows are supported in Doc Central,Doc Central currently supports an approval workflow.  The approval workflow is an ISO approved process that records all workflow history and will replace the approval workflow process in EDCS today.
How do I start a workflow,In order to start a workflow your document needs to be in Draft state. If is not in Draft state select Change Doc Status button and move the document from Approval N.A. to Draft. Once the document is in Draft you will see the Start Workflow button.
What is the difference between a parallel and serial workflow,A parallel workflow will send approval requests to all approvers at one time and there is no order to whom completes their tasks first. Once all approvers have accepted the document it will be marked as approved.  In a serial workflow the order of who you set up as approvers is followed and approver #2 will not get a request to approve the document until approver #1 has completed their task.
What happens when someone rejects a workflow,"When someone who has been asked to approve a document rejects it the rejected task goes back to the originator of the workflow for further action. The originator can then choose to cancel the workflow or resubmit the same document to the approver again with further clarification.
If the document needs to be updated, based on the comments provided by the user who rejected the document, the workflow needs to be cancelled. Once the updates have been made a new workflow can be started."
Who can cancel a workflow,The originator of the workflow plus any user who has Folder Admin rights on the document has the ability to cancel an active workflow.
How do I know if a document is currently in a workflow,"If a document is currently in an active workflow you will notice that the Document Action's menu has limited capabilities. This is because if there is an active workflow going on you do not want other users to be able to checkout, edit or upload a new version of the document."
How do I see the history of past workflows,To view the history of past workflows click on the title of the document to take you to the document details page.  On the right side scroll down to the Workflows menu and select the Workflow History link.
Can I update a document that is in an active workflow,You cannot update a document that is an active workflow. The workflow is for that particular version of the document. Any changes would increment the version and require a new workflow to be started.
How do I publish content from Doc Central to Doc Exchange,"If publishing is enabled from a folder, you can publish files by clicking on the Publish button under Document Actions and following the instructions on the screen. If publishing is disabled you will have to contact your folder admin to enable publishing.* Publishing may be disabled in some folders by design."
If a user uploads a file or a new version of a file in Doc Exchange will that be synced automatically to Doc Central,Currently there is no syncing from Doc Exchange to Doc Central. Users will have to manually upload content to Doc Central.
Why CiscoDocs is beeing migrated,"Cisco Docs uses EMC's Documentum as its back end and this is no longer being supported to the degree that is required by Cisco.  Doc Central, built on top of Alfresco, allows Cisco to meet required security features as well as provide an extendable infrastructure for future growth."
Cisco Docs to Doc Central Migration Overview,"During migration content will continue to be accessible through Cisco Docs.  Cisco Docs has approximately 70 TB of content and much of it is old so not all of it will be migrated.  Content that will be migrated will fall into one or more of these categories:
Content that is marked as a record (records retention schedule)
Content that was created or modified with the past 3 years
Content that was downloaded in the past year
Content that is on ""legal hold"""
What are the migration steps,"Migration will occur in the background during which time you will continue to work in Cisco Docs.  Based on the above freeze dates and cut over schedule, folders will be moved over and made active in Doc Central.
The Cisco Docs content will go to a temporary folder in Doc Central (Cisco Docs and EDCS Legacy -> Cisco Docs - Migration) with the current folder structure you had in Cisco Docs intact.  From this temporary location content owners should organize and move their content to its final ""home"" somewhere outside of this area.
Content will not be moved from the temporary area unless done so by the document owner or business group Folder Admins.  Content not migrated will remain in Cisco Docs for a year during which time you will be able to open a request to move it to Doc Central if needed."
What do I need to do to get ready for the migration,"To get ready for the migration it is best to do a few things ...
Identify where you content is in Cisco Docs.  By doing this you will be ready to organize and move it around once it gets migrated over.
Review the permission access you have set up.  Often groups are used to determine access to content so be sure to review these groups, who is present in them and what type of access they have.
Delete unwanted content.  Remove any empty folders or old documents you no longer require.
Decide who your Folder Admin's will be.  Folder Admin's help to administer the content in a folder area and can create new ones, move them around and rename them.  Decide who your folder admins should be to be in charge of this."
Is there a tool available that lets me migrate my content to Doc Central from Cisco Docs myself,"No. Currently there is no self-migration tool available. We are working on a tool so users can upload lots of documents at a single time, but if you have a significant amount of content in Cisco Docs today, you will need to wait until we are able to migrate over your content over. You could manually move over a small amount of content if you would prefer to do so, but it is not a automated process."
Will the Cisco Docs redirection links still work,Yes they will.  Cisco Doc redirection links till work and be redirected to their location in Doc Central.  We will support those redirects indefinitely but we do encourage you to update your links to use the new Doc Central syntax.
What Cisco Docs features are not yet in DocCentral,"Cisco Docs allows you to delete content.  Doc Central will add this feature, with restrictions, once we have developed and deployed the legal hold feature for Cisco's legal team.
Access reporting.  Cisco Docs provided a way to retrieve access reports on views and downloads.  We are working on adding that report feature."
Do I have an API for application Integration ,"Cisco Docs allows you to delete content.  Doc Central will add this feature, with restrictions, once we have developed and deployed the legal hold feature for Cisco's legal team.
Access reporting.  Cisco Docs provided a way to retrieve access reports on views and downloads.  We are working on adding that report feature."

What are my post migration steps,"Migration will occur in the background during which time you will continue to work in Cisco Docs.  Based on the above freeze dates and cut over schedule, folders will be moved over and made active in Doc Central.
During the freeze period you will have read-only, download access to your Cisco Docs content.  If you have already checked out content in Cisco Docs and need to check it back in during the freeze period, wait till after the freeze period is over and perform an ""Upload New Version"" operation in Doc Central.
Content will not be moved from the temporary area unless done so by the document owner or business group Folder Admins.  This area will never be removed so technically you can keep your content here but we prefer you do not.  The idea is that you take this opportunity to organize your content and its folder structure, review the permissions for the content and then move it to the correct folder under the Documents folder tree.  If you think your content needs to be under the Documents -> Finance area ... use the Request New Folder button to get a folder where you have write access to move the folders/files into.
Your Cisco Docs content will go to a temporary folder in Doc Central (Cisco Docs and EDCS Legacy -> Cisco Docs - Migration) with the current folder structure you had in Cisco Docs intact.  From this temporary location content owners should organize and move their content to its final ""home"" somewhere outside of this area.
The only content not migrated is Cisco Docs archived content.  This content will remain in Cisco Docs for a year during which time you will be able to open a request to move it to Doc Central if needed."
Why can't I delete a document in Doc Central,"Presently the ability to delete a document has been disabled in Doc Central.  We are in the process of migrating terabytes of content from Cisco Docs, some of which are records.  Until these document migrate over and have record retention rules applied we cannot enable the delete feature.  Also there is a feature called ""legal hold"" that the Cisco legal teams need as they work on cases on behalf of Cisco.  That feature, along with records retention, needs to be in place before the delete feature can be enabled.
If you must have a document deleted here are the steps:
Mark the document as Obsolete (use Change Doc Status button).  If document is in Approval N.A. state you need to first make it Draft and then can make it Obsolete.  Making a document Obsolete will also remove it from a normal Doc Central search result (use can, in Advanced Search, search on Obsolete files).
Create a TRASH folder for your group and place your obsoleted documents you want to delete in there.
Periodically open a case to get these files removed.  We ask you not to ask every time you have a single file to delete as this process is a manual task.  The level 1 support team does not have the capability to delete files.  A Doc Central senior tech administrator needs to review the files to make sure they are OK to delete and perform the clean up.
 
In the vast majority of cases the files are ""goofs"" and easy to identify and delete.  This is a temporary process until the migration is done, records are converted and legal holds are put in place.  Estimated time of enabling the delete feature is January 2018."
"How long will the content say in this ""temporary area"" on Doc Central",Content will stay in the temporary location until it's moved or until it has reached its deletion date under the purge rule or record retention rule (depending on whether it has been designated a record or not).
How do I find my content once it is migrated,All migrated content gets placed in he same top level folder of Documents -> Legacy EDCS and Cisco Docs -> Cisco Docs - Migration.  After that level the folder structure is identical to what you are used to seeing in Cisco Docs.  An alternative method to find your documents would be to search by your userid (which is fine unless you own a lot of documents which may give you a lengthy search result).
What content is going to be migrated,"Content that will be migrated will fall into one or more of these categories:
Content that is marked as a record (records retention schedule)
Content that was created or modified with the past 3 years
Content that was downloaded in the past year
Content that is on ""legal hold"""

What are the different Roles in Doc Exchange,"Viewer Role - A Viewer can preview a file online but cannot edit, download or perform any actions on it.
Reader Role - A Reader can do anything a Viewer can do plus they have the ability to download a copy of the file.
Editor Role - An Editor can perform everything a Reader can do plus editing actions such as checking a file in or out of the system and starting an approval or review workflow. If someone has the Editor role on a folder they can bring files into that folder which they will become an Owner of.
Owner Role - An Owner of a file is the user that uploaded the file into Doc Exchange repository. They can perform all Editor role actions plus edit file properties and assign roles to other users for this file. Any new file uploaded into Doc Exchange automatically gives that user the Owner role but owners can also assign other users as an Owner/Editor/Reader/Viewer as well.
Folder Admin Role – Role of a Folder Admin is to manage folders. Folder Admin's can create folders underneath the group's top level folder area, move files between these folders as well as manage permissions for any user as it pertains to these folders and files.
