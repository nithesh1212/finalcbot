What do I need to do to get ready for the migration,faq_intent,FALSE,What do I need to do to get ready for the migration,"To get ready for the migration it is best to do a few things ...
Identify where you content is in Cisco Docs.  By doing this you will be ready to organize and move it around once it gets migrated over.
Review the permission access you have set up.  Often groups are used to determine access to content so be sure to review these groups, who is present in them and what type of access they have.
Delete unwanted content.  Remove any empty folders or old documents you no longer require.
Decide who your Folder Admin's will be.  Folder Admin's help to administer the content in a folder area and can create new ones, move them around and rename them.  Decide who your folder admins should be to be in charge of this.",

We are working on a tool so users can upload lots of documents at a single time, but if you have a significant amount of content in Cisco Docs today, you will need to wait until we are able to migrate over your content over. You could manually move over a small amount of content if you would prefer to do so, but it is not a automated process.",

What are my post migration steps,faq_intent,FALSE,What are my post migration steps,"Migration will occur in the background during which time you will continue to work in Cisco Docs.  Based on the above freeze dates and cut over schedule, folders will be moved over and made active in Doc Central.
During the freeze period you will have read-only, download access to your Cisco Docs content.  If you have already checked out content in Cisco Docs and need to check it back in during the freeze period, wait till after the freeze period is over and perform an ""Upload New Version"" operation in Doc Central.
Content will not be moved from the temporary area unless done so by the document owner or business group Folder Admins.  This area will never be removed so technically you can keep your content here but we prefer you do not.  The idea is that you take this opportunity to organize your content and its folder structure, review the permissions for the content and then move it to the correct folder under the Documents folder tree.  If you think your content needs to be under the Documents -> Finance area ... use the Request New Folder button to get a folder where you have write access to move the folders/files into.
Your Cisco Docs content will go to a temporary folder in Doc Central (Cisco Docs and EDCS Legacy -> Cisco Docs - Migration) with the current folder structure you had in Cisco Docs intact.  From this temporary location content owners should organize and move their content to its final ""home"" somewhere outside of this area.
