"Jenkins job build compilation fails saying compilation error, what to do?","There could be many reasons for this compilation error in your Jenkins job build. it can be possible due to:
**) Actual Code Compilation
There might be the chance when your actual code is not getting compiled properly, and so is the reason it's getting failed in Jenkins too. Best approach will be, always try to execute your build in your local machine/workspace before triggering the build from Jenkins for compiling new changes. Sometimes, you had to wipe out your .m2 repository content from your workspace to make sure, all your dependent package is getting downloaded during the build.

**) Missing dependent package
There might be a chance when your defined dependency didn't get downloaded during the build, either it was not available to download, or due to connection drop. Best approach will be to check the error for the missing dependency jar file and verify from the repository it's getting download from If it's due to connection drop, then you may want to wipe out your workspace and trigger a clean build. 

**) Corrupted dependent package got downloaded during build compilation
Quick workaround will be to wipe-out the workspace and trigger a fresh build, this will make sure that your broken package is getting downloaded properly this time
NOTE:  There might be chance that the .m2 repository of the Jenkins nodes got affected with dependents content and it's not getting fixed by workspace wipeout. During those scenarios, just follow below instaructions:
Go to Jenkins Job configuration page, Build section where maven configuration has been defined, click on Advanced option and select ""Use Private Maven Repository"", select option as ""Local to Workspace"" from drop down list, and save the configuration. Now trigger a new build post wiping out workspace.
